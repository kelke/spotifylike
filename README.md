Since this is a ahk script you need to donwload AutoHotkey and it only works on Windows
https://autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe


# The Debug text is in German!
Feel free to add your own Language tho :)

## Usage
if you have a Mouse like the MX-Master or any other Peripheral that can be customized, just remap a button to launch this script and it should work fine
